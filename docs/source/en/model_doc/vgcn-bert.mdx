# VGCN-BERT

## Overview

The VGCN-BERT model was proposed in [VGCN-BERT: Augmenting BERT with Graph Embedding for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05707) by Zhibin Lu, Pan Du, Jian-Yun Nie.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Much progress has been made recently on text classification with methods based on neural networks. In particular, 
models using attention mechanism such as BERT have shown to have the capability of capturing the contextual information 
within a sentence or document. However, their ability of capturing the global information about the vocabulary of a 
language is more limited. This latter is the strength of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). In this paper, we propose 
VGCN-BERT model which combines the capability of BERT with a Vocabulary Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN). Local 
information and global information interact through different layers of BERT, allowing them to influence mutually and 
to build together a final representation for classification. In our experiments on several text classification datasets, 
our approach outperforms BERT and GCN alone, and achieve higher effectiveness than that reported in previous studies.*
